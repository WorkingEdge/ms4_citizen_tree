Note:
All work on the Shop app closely follows this JustDjango [tutorial and code](https://learn.justdjango.com/roadmaps/django-advanced).
The particular section which served as a resource is the Business Logic section of the Build an E-commerce store with Django tutorial.

More info in the Credits section of the README.
