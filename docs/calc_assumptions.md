For calculations, the following resources were used:
#### Cost of fuel in Ireland
Info from the AA, April 2021:
https://www.theaa.ie/aa/motoring-advice/petrol-prices.aspx
Diesel: 133.8c round to 1.34
Petrol: 142.9c round to 1.43


#### Emissions from diesel/petrol
Diesel = 2600g/l
Comprises 720g C in the diesel + 1,920g O2 to combust it.

Petrol = 2300g/l
Comprises 652g C in the petrol and 1740g O2 to combust it.

### Hazelnut orchards - sequestration (Italy)

"Overall, during the year, from the structural maturation of leaves to the beginning of leaf senescence, the hazelnut
orchards, under consideration removed from the atmosphere, a total amount of CO2 equal to 58.8 ± 9.1 Mg(CO2) ha-1 year-1 (mean value), corresponding to an amount of C equal to 16.0 ± 2.5 Mg ha-1 year-1."
At 400 bushes/ha, that works out to approx 145Kg CO2/bush per year.

### Ireland:
COFORD report may be outdated: http://www.coford.ie/media/coford/content/publications/projectreports/carbonseq-Irishforests.pdf
Estimates: 1.8Mg/ha/year for oak/beech and 2.4Mg/ha per year for 'other conifers

"As well as attaining conservation objectives over a shorter timeframe by accelerating canopy closure, closer spacings (e.g. 2.0 m x
2.5 m to give 2000 stems/ha) will also result in less follow-up maintenance, especially vegetation control (Fig. 5)."
 => 2000 trees/ha)

Donation conversion to trees = 50euro: 20 trees
 = 1% of a ha.
